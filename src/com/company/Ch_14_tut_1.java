               ==> There are three types of errors in java. ==>
                        1) Syntax errors
                        2) Logical errors
                        3) Runtime errors- also called Exceptions

               ==>==>==>==>==>==>==>==> Syntax Errors -----------------------
                  * When complex finds something wrong with our program, it throws a syntax error -
                  example -
                            int   a = 9  // No semicolon, syntax errors!
                                  a =   a + 3;
                                  d = 4; // Variable not declared, syntax errors

                ==>==>==>==>==>==>==>==> Logical errors -----------------------
                   * A logical error or a bug occurs when a program compiles and round but does the wrong thing.
                        - Message delivered wrongly
                        - Wrong time of chats being displayed
                        - Incorrect redirects!

                ==>==>==>==>==>==>==>==> Runtime errors -----------------------
          * Java may sometimes encounter an error while the program is running. These are also called Exceptions!
            These are encountered due to circumstances like bad input and (or) resource constraints.
                Ex: User supplies 'S' + 8 to a program which adds 2 numbers.

      Syntax errors and logical errors are encountered by the programmers where as Runtime errors are encountered by the users.
