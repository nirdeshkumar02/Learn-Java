     ==============> Why do we need collections ==============>
           We need collections for efficient storage and better manipulation of data in java.

     ===> For ex: we use arrays to store integers but what if we want to
           * Resize this array?
           * Insert an element in between?
           * Delete an elements in Array?
           * Apply certain operations to change this array?
